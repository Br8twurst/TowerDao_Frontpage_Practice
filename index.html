                The Tower is a futuristic skyscraper in the metaverse of Solana. 10k Residences were minted!
                <br><br>
                Our goal is simple, we want to create a place that <o>everyone</o> in the Solana ecosystem can join,
                while maintaining a project that grows in size and utility for years to come.

                The Tower was born from our goal to create an NFT project that could someday onboard millions of people into crypto. We believe that a place everyone can live together, 
                <o>The Tower</o>, is our way to do just this.
                <br><br>
                Our first and foremost goal is deliver a wonderful product to those in The Tower - NFT Galleries and Common Room spaces. 
                We want to create something that is fun, interactive, and easily accessible.
            </p>
            <div class="second_element">
                <p>
                    Longer term we envision an ecosystem built from a <o>community of communities</o>. The TowerDAO will exist to support Residents, uplift projects, and ensure the success of our community and product for years to come.
                    As with any product scaled to millions of people, next steps and product decisions will be brought to light as we proceed. 
                    Each step we win unlocks a new step to take The Tower to even greater heights.

                built upon the strengths of the communities supporting it and working with the agility and governance of a scaled DAO.
                We want to create a project that anyone in the ecosystem can join, while still ensuring that market dynamics and scarcity remain. 
                Through Residences and our roommate model The Tower will stand as a project that will evolve and morph for years to come.
